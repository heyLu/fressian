(not sure against what, would require having some data to use and a benchmark suite for `Datomic/fressian`)\r\n- the far future\r\n    - i also want an `edn` reader (and writer, just for fun)\r\n    - coincidentally, datomic queries are also `edn` data...\r\n    - maybe rename this `clog`? (negative connotations, though.) maybe `clogs`? (\"Holzpantoffel\", not exactly fancy, but kind of cute and indicates that this has multiple things. (`fressian`, `edn`, ...))\r\n\r\nAt this point, I think that we have the world's second most advanced fressian reader? That's... interesting. :)",
